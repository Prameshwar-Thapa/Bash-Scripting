Arithmetic Operations in Bash Scripting
Bash provides robust support for performing arithmetic operations directly within scripts, making it a powerful tool for automating tasks involving calculations. Arithmetic expressions in Bash can be evaluated using several methods, each with its own syntax and capabilities.

‚úÖ Supported Operators
Bash supports the following basic arithmetic operators:

Operator	Description	Example
+	Addition	a + b
-	Subtraction	a - b
*	Multiplication	a * b
/	Division	a / b
%	Modulo (remainder)	a % b
**	Exponentiation	a ** b
++	Increment	((a++))
--	Decrement	((a--))

Note: Bash performs integer arithmetic only. For floating-point calculations, you must use external tools like bc or awk.

üîß Methods for Performing Arithmetic
1. let Command
The let command evaluates arithmetic expressions.

bash
Copy
Edit
let a=5
let b=3
let result=a+b
echo "Result: $result"
2. (( )) ‚Äì Arithmetic Expansion
Double parentheses allow cleaner syntax and can be used with or without let.

bash
Copy
Edit
a=5
b=3
result=$((a + b))
echo "Result: $result"
Variables can be used directly (without $).

Supports complex expressions and operator precedence.

3. $[ ] ‚Äì Deprecated Style (Use $(( )) Instead)
bash
Copy
Edit
a=5
b=3
result=$[$a + $b]   # Deprecated
echo "Result: $result"
‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated: Avoid using this in new scripts. Prefer $(( )) for clarity and future compatibility.

4. expr Command
An external command for basic arithmetic. Requires spaces between operands and operators.

bash
Copy
Edit
a=5
b=3
result=$(expr $a + $b)
echo "Result: $result"
‚ö†Ô∏è Slower than internal arithmetic. Quotes are needed if using *:
expr $a \* $b

5. Using bc for Floating-Point Arithmetic
bash
Copy
Edit
a=5.2
b=3.1
result=$(echo "$a + $b" | bc)
echo "Result: $result"
